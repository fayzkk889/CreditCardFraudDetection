# Credit Card Fraud Detection (ML with Explainability)

## Problem
Detect fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset using advanced ML + SHAP explainability.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- XGBoost, SMOTE, SHAP
- ROC-AUC, PR Curve, Confusion Matrix

## ML Pipeline
- Oversampled minority class using SMOTE
- Trained XGBoost with tuned hyperparameters
- Achieved **94% Recall**, **88% Precision**

## Explainability with SHAP
- Global and local feature importance
- Visualized key features driving fraud predictions

## Results
- ROC-AUC Score: 0.98+
- High recall and precision on rare fraud samples


## Learnings
- Handling imbalanced data
- Model interpretability with SHAP
- Real-world fraud analytics workflows
